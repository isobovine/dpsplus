_Abstract_

We present a stronger version of the Doherty–Parrilo–Spedalieri (DPS)
hierarchy of approximations for the set of separable states. Unlike
DPS, our hierarchy converges exactly at a finite number of rounds for
any fixed input dimension. This yields an algorithm for separability
testing that is singly exponential in dimension and polylogarithmic in
accuracy. Our analysis makes use of tools from algebraic geometry, but
our algorithm is elementary and differs from DPS only by one simple
additional collection of constraints.
